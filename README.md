This project involves extracting vocal tracks from music mixtures using a deep learning approach. The process includes generating spectrograms of audio tracks, training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to isolate vocals, and evaluating the performance of the model.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to isolate the vocal component from a music mixture using a deep learning model. The input to the model is a spectrogram of the mixture, and the output is a mask that identifies vocal regions in the time-frequency domain. This mask is used to reconstruct the vocal spectrogram, which is then converted back into an audio signal.
